# Personal Libraries
These are where I put helper functions and other little constructs that I don't want to publish per se, but still want access to use and work with.

## ./Python - fuckinshit
Install via:
```shell
pip3 install -e ~/lib/python/
```
and use like so:
```python3
from fuckinshit import vprint, vpprint
```
